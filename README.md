 Overview:
This C++ program searches for link words in text. A compound word is a word formed by combining two or more smaller words  in the same text. The program uses the Trie database to  store and search beautiful words. 

Approach:

Triple Data Structure: We use one to try to store the correct words in the input data. Trie allows  quick messages and follow-up instructions. 

Recursive join check: To determine whether a word is a combination of smaller words, the program uses an iterative method that checks each individual word word. word.&lt; br&gt;
Data processing: We use std::ifstream to read  input data. The program reads the data twice: once to write to the experiment and once to recreate the vector line. 

Method:

The program creates a Trie file to store a single character file. 
 
Reads text input data into a Trie and simultaneously creates  text line vectors. 

The program then searches for several matching words, starting with the longest word. It uses  Trie to check whether words can be formed by combining smaller words. 

The results will be printed to the console. 
 
Sample output:

Copy code
Longest concatenated word: concatenated word1
Longest concatenated word: concatenated word2
